# odscmeetupdvc
DVC demo for ODSC meetup Delhi
This Code is kind of replication of the code https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/static/docs/tutorial (Thanks to DVC org for such a good code)
I have added the shell script to quickly run it in sequence rather than typing all the commands by hand
```
samplecode.sh
setupdvc.sh
initdvc.sh
initdata.sh
rundvc.sh
runmodel.sh
modeleval.sh
repro.sh
datapush.sh
mastercheckout.sh
mastermerge.sh
tuningcommit.sh
pullrepro.sh
```
