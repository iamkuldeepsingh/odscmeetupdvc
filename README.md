# DVC demo for ODSC meetup Delhi
This Code is replication of the code https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/tree/master/static/docs/tutorial (Thanks to DVC org for such a nice code), I have added the shell script to quickly run it in sequence rather than typing all the commands by hand during practise session.

We will run the scripts one by one and then explain all the backend steps it ran

```
samplecode.sh
setupdvc.sh
initdvc.sh
initdata.sh
rundvc.sh
runmodel.sh
repro.sh
Adding bigrams (Manual Steps)
modeleval.sh
mastercheckout.sh
Tune the model (Manual Steps)
tuningcommit.sh
datapush.sh
mastermerge.sh
pullrepro.sh

```
